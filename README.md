This is a JavaScript color game that tests your knowledge on RGB colors. The game has two modes: Easy and Hard.

For the Easy mode, you are given a random RGB number (in this format: RGB(9, 162, 27) for example), and then you are given 6 different colors, which one of them corresponds to the given RGB number. You are to guess the right color by clicking on the different suqare colors. If you click a wrong color, the square will disappear. If you click the right color, all six squares will change color to the correct one.
